This is an OwnCloud based server intended to serve as a backup for local machines.  To successfully implement this, you will need a machine with Docker installed, since this will be running as a container, and not as a virtual machine.  To start, go to https://doc.owncloud.com/server/admin_manual/installation/docker/ and copy the docker-compose.yml file to a location on the local machine that is convenient for you to get to.  You will also need to create a .env file (no file name, just a file with a .env extension).  This will serve as the file where all the environmental variables are kept, such as the admin user name and password.  A note worth mentioning.  The .env file may appear as a hidden file, so it is recommended to use a command line to access the directory, and not a GUI, since you may not be able to see hidden files with a GUI.

Once the docker-compose and .env files are created, start Docker on the local machine if it is not already started.  Once Docker is up and running, navigate to the directory where you have the docker-compose and .env files, and run the command "docker-compose up" which will start the services in the docker-compose file.  Wait to see if the services start successfully.  To test to see if the OwnCloud service started, open a web browser and go to "https://localhost:8080" (or whatever port you specified in the .env file).  If OwnCloud started successfully, you should see the OwnCloud login screen.  Log in with the admin name and password specified in the .env file.  Once logged in, you should see the OwnCloud interface.  This is where you can move files to be backed up.
