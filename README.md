# IT610Project
Project for IT 610 Fall 2020

This project is a server based on the OwnCloud image in Docker Hub.  The intended purpose of this is to backup local machines, as well as other files at office locations, and to create a central database for files for offices that may have multiple locations.  The setup process will be documented in a text file called setup.txt, and a user guide will be provided as a file called UserGuide.txt.

This will initially be maintained by the developer, with the eventual goal of being transferred to a company's internal network, where they can manage the server.
