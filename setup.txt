This project will be running OwnCloud inside a container.  To start the project, I went to https://doc.owncloud.com/server/admin_manual/installation/docker/ to see how to install the Owncloud server on Docker.  I copied the text for the docker-compose.yml file and pasted it into a new file in this GitHub repository.  I then changed the line reading "files: mnt/data to read $(PWD):mnt/data, so that the volume would be mounted on the local machine in addition to the OwnCloud container.  Once that was done, I created the .env file as mentioned, changing the user credentials to something that made sense for this project, as well as something that was relatively secure for password purposes.  Once that was done, I ran the docker-compose up command as stated in the link above.  Once I verified the services started successfully, I went to http://localhost:8080.  I did see the OwnCloud login screen, so I knew that the OwnCloud service did start successfully and there were no errors.

I then logged into Owncloud using the credentials in the .env file.  Once I was there, as a test, I put several files in the OwnCloud server using the OwnCloud interface.  Opening a new Terminal window, I navigated to the /mnt/data directory, then searched for the files that I had uploaded.  I did see that they were in sub-directories in that directory, where they should be, so at that point, I knew the files were uploaded to the server.
